# devops virtual environment

This repository creates a `python` based virtual environment using `uv` and automatically installs the dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file into the environment.

## üöÄ Motivation

The virtual environment created by this repository is designed for developing Ansible roles and playbooks, as well as for working on devops related activities.

The main advantage of using a virtual environment is its ability to isolate dependencies, ensuring that the packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file won't interfere with or affect other packages installed on your system.

## üß∞ Dependencies

- [uv][01]

Refer to your operating system's package manager or documentation to install the dependencies on your machine.

## ‚ö° Quick start

1. To create and initialize the `python` based virtual environment, run `make bootstrap`.

1. Switch to any directory where you are working on Ansible related activities to leverage tools like `ansible`, `ansible-creator`, `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-lint`, `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-vault`, `molecule`, `pre-commit` and `yamllint`.

   1. To create a new Ansible role: `ansible-galaxy role init role-name`. More details can be found [here][02].

   1. To create a new Ansible project: `ansible-creator init playbook organization.project`. More details can be found [here][03].

1. When you are finished with your work, simply exit the virtual environment by typing `exit` in the terminal. This will bring you back to the directory where this repository is located.

1. To completely remove the virtual environment, run `make cleanup`.
